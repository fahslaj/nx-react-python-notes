# NxReactPythonNotes

A simple example of a full-stack application with a React Native UI and Python API, all managed with Nx.

## Installation of Python

We are using the @nxlv/python package, so make sure that node_modules are updated with npm.

python and poetry will need to be installed to build and run the application. Follow these steps to get your environment ready:

Check if your version of python is at least 3.9 with python3 -V

If it is not at least 3.9, please update python to >=3.9
Install poetry with this command:

```sh
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Once installed, install python deps with poetry install.

## Run tasks

To run the application, you will need to serve both the API and the app:

```sh
npx nx serve notes-api
```

```sh
npx nx serve nx-react-python-notes
```

Then, open the application at http://lcoalhost:4200/

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project nx-react-python-notes
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

To see a graph of the projects in the workspace, run:

```sh
npx nx graph
```

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/react-native:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/react:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

To generate a new Python project, you can use generators provided by the [@nxlv/python plugin](https://github.com/lucasvieirasilva/nx-plugins/tree/main/packages/nx-python#add-a-new-python-project).

## Install Nx Console

Nx Console is an editor extension that enriches your developer experience. It lets you run tasks, generate code, and improves code autocompletion in your IDE. It is available for VSCode and IntelliJ.
